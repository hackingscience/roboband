/**
 *	Similar operation as the SClang class
 *	of the same name, but slightly different implementation,
 *	based on the new <code>OSCMultiResponder</code> class
 *	and <code>NetUtil</code>.
 *	<P>
 *	<B>As of v0.29</B> the creator signature had to be changed to use a <code>Server</code> instead
 *	of a network address, unfortunately (a side effect of using <code>OSCClient</code> in <code>Server</code>
 *	and <code>OSCMultiResponder</code>). So you may need to update old code.
