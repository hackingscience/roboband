/**
 *	Quite a 1:1 translation from SClang, this
 *	is used as the default node allocator by the server.
 *	
 *	@todo	allocPerm should be more generally available
 *			from other classes such as Synth and Group,
 *			because it can be vital to sound installation
 *			programming where the non-perm node count
 *			might well end up at the maximum value(?)
 *
 *	@todo	should check if user-max should be one less
 *			because java ints are signed?!
